I started "vibe coding" straight after ChatGPT came out. In those days you had to ask explicitly to get code blocks back, copy and paste the result into your editor, and so on... you know, like savages...

Even though it was just for fun, It quickly helped me to come to the realisation that there are some tasks in software engineering I wasn't finding enjoyable or valuable and those were the tasks I slowly wanted to delegate more and more to the LLMs

Fast forward to today and a single prompt can produce incredible working software. Removing not just the "painful parts" but perhaps also the enjoyable" parts

Which ones are you letting go?

## The personal blog:

There was a time when software engineers use to rewrite their personal websites using a different technology to try out new frameworks and patterns.

I did this too. Back in 2019, I built my own blog using Micro-Frontends even though that was a stupid idea and it is not the right use case for Micro-Frontends, but at the time my day job at Amex involved using a micro-frontend framework so I wanted to dog food our own product and find the gaps in devex and functionality.

That was a pain... but a good kind of pain. I learned a lot about the framework and provided valuable feedback (which in turn got me a promotion and a place into the core team)

I guess I am not the only one who doesn't find "rewriting their personal blog" enjoyable anymore, since it is just a prompt away and there are so many other "fun" ideas that you could build instead. (this site was written by Opus and Codex in 30mins with a couple of prompts)

## Writing code is a battle against the machine (or it used to be)

If I ask you what are the most valuable lessons you learned in your coding career, I can guarantee is not that fancy feature you wrote but the crazy impossible bug that nobody could've predicted and took days, research and "pain" to find and fix

I call this "the battle against the machine" where machines don't do what they are meant to and it is your job to "fight" it, until the "communication gap" and "intent" in its programming is resolved. This fight arises from the fact the intent by the developer is not understood by the machine and produces bugs.

 However, most of those battles are not worth fighting for, they never were. Take debugging a CI/CD pipeline issue where there are hundreds of moving parts, dependencies and tooling involved. You just want your changes to be in front of your users, it doesn't matter how they get there, but in my career I lost count on how many hours I've spent fighting the pipelines to get something working. Or a type error that you spent hours trying to fix so you have the confidence don't introduce a hypothetical future bug.

## Is code 

I took a compiler class during my master and every single project idea was around translating english to machine code.

Those kind of tasks are the ones I hope are fully automated away and I am more than happy to not have to deal with them anymore! but what about those instances were it was the most memorable lesson achieved through struggle and ingenuity?

What left? What are the enjoyable parts of software engineering? Is the outcome? the act of creating something out of nothing out of the human will?

Some people like Pete don't even read the code anymore? was the code just the only way we had to communicate and close the gap but now that language models "understand us" that tool is no longer needed?

I don't know.

I am having a lot of fun creating things, I brought the "joy of programming" back: ** insert year end blog post**

Now there's a different type of pain. (you are absolutely right!)
